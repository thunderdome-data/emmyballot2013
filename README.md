Emmy Ballot 
========================

What is this?
-------------

A PHP and JS tool to display nominees in an event and collect user votes on predicted winners. This was originally built for the 2013 Emmys and has been refactored to be reusable year after year.

2013 demo: http://www.contracostatimes.com/ci_24105588

Assumptions
-----------

* JQuery
* PHP
* MySQL
* Google Doc


What's in here?
---------------

The project contains the following folders and important files:

* ``index.php`` -- main file.
* ``JS`` -- JavaScript files. vote.js has all the action and business logic.
* ``data`` -- Data files, in a CSV, JSON and SQL formats.
* ``incl`` -- PHP file to record user's selections/votes
* ``css`` -- Base css files to get rolling with.

How to use this
----------------

1. Make a copy of these Google docs:
	categories: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Apk83VzG7OVldHZGckZSY0JYU0w3TWN6QTFmOUlMcUE&usp=drive_web#gid=0
	nominees: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Apk83VzG7OVldEJJdWRTejlKdkt3WWNkTjMzS2h0UWc&usp=drive_web#gid=0
	
2. upload your data to MySQL tables.
3. Change the SQL calls to your named tables in index.php, nominees.php, print.php, results.php.
4. Copy the data/Connection.class.php.example into somewhere on your php include path. Change its name to Connection.class.php. Edit where appropriate.

Recommendation: remove static data (nominees names, category names etc.) from the database and pull them in from CSV or JSON files. Only use the database for vote count.

## Gotchas

There are things that are hard-coded into js/vote.js. One of those things is the number of categories, which changes from year to year.

Also hard-coded: This app works differently before the winners are announced than it does after, and we need to write instructions on how to handle both (right now it's set for before the winners are announced).
